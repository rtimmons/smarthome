    # This is gross. home-assistant will on-demand install dependency packages depending on
    # which integrations you enable (or it decides to install on its own for some reason).
    # Some of these dependencies are VERY expensive to install as they involve compiling entire
    # large C++ codebases. This basically brings the whole rpi down as it maxes the CPU for an
    # extended period of time. If we do it at deploy time while hass is down we can prevent it
    # from trying to install at runtime.
