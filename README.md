Smarthome Dashboard
============================

## Setup and Install

- Buy üçìpi 3 and sd card
    - pi3 is the only one tested for now. Zero W should work with minor tweaks to ansible code, though.
    - don't get a cheap sd card. Pay the extra $5.
	- install heatsink, put in case, plug into wall. Heatsink is apparently necessary.
- Follow [setup steps](./setup.md)

## TODO

- music
	- "Play all from" join button
	- Preset music
	- mute
	- pause
	- global pause

- all to TV
- all to music

- pandora
	- thumbs-up
	- skip
	- thumbs-down

- lights
	- control any hue lights
	- control any smartthings lights

- routing
	- preset room based on `#!/${room}`

- state management
	- periodically update volume %age

- ui foo
	- why is the `<marquee>` for the status not clipping and scrolling?

- code foo
	- don't do fixed html table, just let code generate grid. Assign `x,y` values and then listeners?
	- pull hook or something to update cache.manifest since mobile safari doesn't refresh very well

- make development more sustainable
    - UI
        - webpack/babel (https://www.evernote.com/l/AAGQBWjMhuBLYqbDMKJfcYJ6hrRv73LLnxE)
        - consider react but meh
        - def want typescript
    - ExpressServer
        - mocha testing
        - better live-reload situation
    - JS in general (UI and ExpressServer)
        - lint and format js
    - repo
        - plugin model (all the ui stuff together including ansible, etc)
    - ansible
        - remove deprecations
        - lint yaml
        - figure out if there is anything running as root that shouldn't be
    - integrations
        - KMS or hashicorp vault for better secrets management
        - Grafana for metrics

## System Ideas / Dumping Ground

- Maybe [Lutron Cas√©ta][lc]?

- Look into [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

- Look into [openHab](http://www.openhab.org/)

- Look into "Home Assistant" as detailed by holman [here][ha]

- Look into [Nekmo/amazon-dash](https://github.com/Nekmo/amazon-dash) as an
  alternative to Dasher

- Incorporate [mozilla open gateway][moz]. OR: [node-red][nr]?
